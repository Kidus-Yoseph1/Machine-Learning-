# Churn Prediction Model

This project is an impplementation on  building and evaluating a customer churn prediction model. The model is built using a pipeline that includes data preprocessing, various machine learning classifiers, and hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`. The best-performing model is then saved for future use.

## Project Structure

-   `Model.ipynb`: The original Jupyter Notebook where the initial exploration and model building were performed.
-   `cleaned_churn_data.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
-   `model.py`: A refactored, modular version of the notebook code.
-   `requirements.txt`: A list of all necessary libraries to run the project.
-   `LightGBM_Model.pkl`: The final trained model saved as a pickle file.
